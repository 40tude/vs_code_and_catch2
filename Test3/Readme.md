# Test 3
- Compare to Test 2 we go one step further... 
- The project now involves 2 different libraries (factorial and string_left_pad)
- In addition to the tests, the project now have an application (in the app subdirectory) 
- The CMakefile not only generates the libs and the test application but also the application itself (see app.exe)
- Other than that the process of generation is similar to the one used in Test 2
